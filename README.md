## Game Flow
Players take turns one after another. A turn consists of:

- Roll Dice
- Earn Income
- Construction

Game End: The player to construct all four of their Landmarks first wins the game!

## Roll Dice

- At the start of the game, each player will roll a single dice. 
- Once a player has built their Train Station, they may roll one or two dice on their turn. 
- When rolling two dice, the dice are always summed together. 

## Earn Income

- Players earn income based on the dice roll and the effects of the Establishments they own that match the dice roll. 
- The dice roll to activate the Establishment's effect is shown at the top of each card. (Hover over the names to view the card) 
- If a player owns multiple copies of a single Establishment, the effects are multiplied by the number of Establishments of that type owned. 
- It is possible that multiple types of Establishments are activated by the same die roll. In this case, the Establishments are activated in the following order: 
    - Red Establishments
    - Green and Blue Establishments
    - Purple Establishments

## Coin Transactions Between Players

- If a player owes another player money and cannot afford to pay it, they pay what they can and the rest is exempted. 
- A player's coin total can never go below zero. 
- The receiving player is not compensated for the lost income. 
- If payment is owed to multiple players at the same time, payment is processed in reverse player order. 

## Building New Establishments and Completing Landmarks

- To conclude a player's turn, they may pay to construct one single Establishment OR one single Landmark. 
- The cost is shown on the bottom left corner of each card. (Hover over the names to view the card) 
- Landmarks may be constructed in any order the player chooses. 
- A player may construct as many unique purple Establishments as they choose, but may never construct a second purple establishment of the same card. 
- There are only 6 of each Establishment (except for purple Establishments). 
- Once 6 of an Establishment have been bought, players cannot buy any more of that Establishment.
